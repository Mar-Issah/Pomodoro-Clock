## About The Project

![Pomodoro Clock](https://res.cloudinary.com/dytnpjxrd/image/upload/v1617412489/My%20Website%20Projects/pomodoro_clock_ep2eew.png)

Pomodoro clock is a project that works on desktop. The aim of this app is to help users focus on any task they are working on, such as writing, or coding. This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started
This is JavaScript Web application which runs in the browser. You need a V8 engine to run JavaScript program. For the purpose of this project I used Google Chrome browser.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Node, yarn and npm installed on your machine. To check if they are installed, open up a terminal window and type the following:
 ```sh
npm -v
yarn -v
node -v
   ```
   
If these commands print out a version number in the terminal, you are good to go. If not, you need to go ahead and install what is missing. For the purpose of this project, I used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo on your local machine
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mar-Issah/Pomodoro-Clock.git
   ```
2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Change directory into the new folder and type the following, this installs the required dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
   ```
4. To run the React project.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
The app consists of a break length which by default displays 5, a session length which by default displays 25 and a timer display which correspond with the session length.
The lengths also has increase and decrease buttons to set the values, a play/pause and reset buttons to play, pause or reset the timer respectively.

When the clock start, the timer begins running from the value currently displayed in the session length. When the time reaches 00:00 it plays a beep sound and switches to the break mode running from the value displayed in the break length.
